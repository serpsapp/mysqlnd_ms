1.4.0 alpha

  Motto/theme: Tweaking based on user feedback
  Release date: TBD

  * BC break: renamed ini setting "ini_file" to "config_file".
    Earlier versions have been configured through an ini style file
    and its name was set with the ini setting "ini_file". The ini
    style soon got replaced with JSON. We are now updating the file name
    to config_file to leave the past behing and avoid confusion with
    the PHP configuration file

  * New config setting: offline_server_charset. Allows setting of charset
    to be used for string encoding before connections have been opened.
    Most useful with lazy connections.

  * Improved error messages if opening and/or parsing of plugin
    configuration file fails.

  * Added "wait_for_gtid_timeout" for throttling of read-your-write SELECTs

  * New failover strategy "loop_before_master". If connecting to a slave
    fails the plugin can either return an error to the caller
    (strategy "disabled", default), fall back to the master (stategy "master") or
    try to connect to any of the other slaves before connecting to the master
    (stategy "loop_before_master").

  * New "max_retries" setting to be used with fail over strategy "loop_before_master".
    If "max_retries" is set to 0 (default), all alternatives will be tested
    and the search is unlimited. Set max_retries to n to limit slave connection attempts
    to n attempts before falling back to master. If, multiple master are configured
    and max_retries = n != 0, then n masters are tested. No matter whether there
    was a slave loop before or not. This means that there can be update 2 * n
    connection attempts before the plugin gives up.


1.3.2 stable

  Release date: 04/2012

  * Fixed problem with multi-master where although in a transaction
   the queries to the master weren't sticky and were spread all

   is not affected.
