PECL/mysqlnd_ms is a mysqlnd library plugin or read-write splitting and
load balancing to support use of MySQL replication with PHP.

R/W splitting is very basic: everything that is not a SELECT is send
to the master. Everything else goes to the slaves.  R/W splitting can be
controlled by SQL hints and/or done by a user defined callback.

Which slave is "picked" is determined by the configured load balancing polic.
PECL/mysqlnd_ms has built-in functionality for random, random-once,
round-robin and user defined load balancing.

PECL/mysqlnd_ms has no automatic fail over. Manual fail over is easy:
catch the error and run the same query again to make the load balancer choose
the next server. Catching should be easy because you always check for return
codes, don't you?

The plugin operates transparently from a users point of view.
As a mysqlnd library plugin it operated on a layer beneath the user APIs
provided by any of the PHP mysql extensions.

Do not use PECL/mysqlnd_ms in production environments, yet!
It is a proof-of-concept. It is pre-alpha!
