Edit config.inc prior to running the tests.

Some tests require the availability of a master and a slave server. The two
MySQL server must be uniquely defined by their host names.
The two servers do not need to be setup as a MySQL replication master and a
MySQL replication slave. They do not need to be related in any way. We
are not testing replication as such. All we need is two distrinct MySQL servers
to get two distinct connection URIs.

All configures hosts must use the same user, password settings.
Using host[:port|socket] you can set the port respectively socket of the
master and slave server. If not give, MYSQL_TEST_SOCKET and MYSQL_TEST_PORT
are used.

MYSQL_TEST_MASTER_HOST="localhost"
MYSQL_TEST_SLAVE_HOST="localhost"

Example using host[:port|socket] syntax:

MYSQL_TEST_MASTER_HOST="127.0.0.1:3307"
MYSQL_TEST_SLAVE_HOST="localhost:/tmp/mysql2.sock"
